# BrainF-ck-Interpreter

Just a quick 15 minute endevour to write a brainf*ck interpreter, as I've written so many for so many different programming languages, 
but I guess I never saved them. Well, that changes today. However, kinda wish I wrote this in java instead of processing, as processing
doesn't have a good way of taking input. There also isn't any error handling, so this is entirely just to record the logic somewhere. 
Will probably write a much better one in C.
